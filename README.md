# REFRAME

 Goal of the project - The goal of this project is to develop and optimize an NLP deep-learning model that reiterates text affirmations to users utilizing a smooth and 
reassuring voice generated by employing voice cloning and speech recognition methods from the Tacotron 2 model.

Problem Statement:
In the realm of mental health and well-being, providing users with personalized and reassuring affirmations can significantly contribute to their positive mindset. However, existing methods lack a seamless integration of Natural Language Processing (NLP) and voice generation technologies. Furthermore, many a times these methods are unable to remove a particular machine feeling to the voice generated. This project aims to address this gap by developing and optimizing an NLP deep-learning model that delivers reiterated text affirmations to users through a smooth and reassuring voice generated via voice cloning and speech recognition methods.


Hypothesis:
By combining advanced NLP techniques with state-of-the-art voice cloning and speech recognition technologies, we hypothesize that we can create an innovative and effective system for delivering positive affirmations. The integration of Tacotron 2 model for voice generation, which is an LSTM-based NLP model, is expected to produce a personalized and emotionally resonant experience for users. We anticipate that the implementation of this integrated system will lead to improved user engagement and well-being, fostering a positive impact on mental health.
